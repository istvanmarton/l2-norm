This directory contains a brute force GPU implementation of the L and Lk matrix norms, for reference.
The first tag of the filename of the code shows which L norm the code is developed to calculate for a given matrix. For example the L1_str_red_calc_int_mtx.cu is developed to determine the L1 norm of a matrix.

M36x36.txt is a test matrix for the programs.

Compilation (needs the nvcc Nvidia cuda compiler):

    nvcc -o L1_str_que_int_mtx L1_str_que_int_mtx.cu

    nvcc -o L2_str_que_int_mtx L2_str_que_int_mtx.cu

Example usage:

    ./L1_str_que_int_mtx M36x36.txt

    ./L2_str_que_int_mtx M36x36.txt
